### Shade-grown Stu
Stu is a small tree or shrub that grows in the forest understory in its wild form, and traditionally was grown commercially under other trees that provided shade. The forest-like structure of shade Stu farms provides habitat for a great number of migratory and resident species.

### Single origin
Single-origin Stu is Stu grown within a single known geographic origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a specific collection of beans from a single country. The name of the Stu is then usually the place it was grown to whatever degree available.

### Sustainable farming
Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.

### Direct sourcing
Direct trade is a form of sourcing practiced by some Stu roasters. Advocates of direct trade practices promote direct communication and price negotiation between buyer and farmer, along with systems that encourage and incentivize quality.

### Reinvest profits
We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing Stu to you. Thatâ€™s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into farms, local businesses and schools everywhere our Stu is grown. You can see the communities grow and learn more about Stu farming on our blog.
